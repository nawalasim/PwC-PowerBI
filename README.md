The problem required defining KPIs and delivering recommendations. Hence the churn statistics were analyzed for all the different variables and a 3 page report was created on PowerBI.

The first page contained the customer churn statistics:

The second page of the report contained the Churn Risk Analysis and multiple visuals were used to make better sense of the data and find out what category of customers were the most likely to churn. The dashboard for page 2 is as follows:

Finally, the key insights and recommendation were provided on a third page along with the key influencers visual that provides more insight using Machine Learcing algorithMs regaring what factors impacted churn rate the most:
